# Zoom to Pardot Country and State Mapping

This JavaScript script is designed for use with **Zapier** to automate the mapping of country and state abbreviations from **Zoom** webinar registration data to full names compatible with **Pardot**.

---

## Features

- **Country Mapping**: Converts two-letter country abbreviations (e.g., `US`) to full names (e.g., `United States`).
- **State Mapping**: Converts US state, Canadian province, and other regional abbreviations to full names.
- **Fallback Handling**: If no mapping is found, the original abbreviation is returned.
- **Customizable**: Extend or modify the `countryMap` and `stateMap` as required.

---

## Requirements

- **Zapier** account.
- Zoom and Pardot integration setup in Zapier.
- Webinar registration data containing `countryAbbr` and `stateAbbr`.
